# Electron+Webpack+TypeScript minimalistic boilerplate

This is the samplest minimalistic boilerplate that uses Electron, Webpack and TypeScript. Both renderer and main process in TypeScript and built using Webpack.

To run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
To build a package:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run package
```
I've tested building a setup package on Windows only. Should be easy to fix on other platforms if any bugs will be found.
